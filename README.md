### Introduction
The program makes use of a timer to record the duration of a particular task. The user begins the task by typing in the task name and ends the task by typing 'Stop'. The system's date automatically records the start and stop times of the task. The amount of time spent on the task is calculated and the user is asked to input the hourly rate for payment.
The app then calculates the amount of money the user would be paid for the task. 

### Modules used
The datetime and time modules were used to manipulate dates and time inputs as well as pandas library for creating tables and indexes for the results of the manipulation.
Inputs and respective results are stored in an excel file to allow for future referencing. 

### Next Steps
I am working on how to output the total money earned after all the individual tasks have been completed.
I would like to create a graphical user interface and/or an API for the app.

### Collaboration Welcome
